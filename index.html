								<b>Education:</b>
								I grew up in a small town in Karnataka, India. I went to high school in Raichur, and then moved to Bengaluru for my undergrad in Electronics & Comminication Enginnering at RV College of Engineering. I graduated in 2020 ranking 3rd in the University, with my thesis on 'Search for Galactic and high redshift absorption lines with LOFAR'.
								 I then moved to Tempe Arizona, where I got a Ph.D. in Astrophysics from the <a href="https://loco.lab.asu.edu"> School of Earth and Space Exploration</a>, Arizona State University. I am currently a <a href= https://physics.richmond.edu/faculty/avydula/"> Postdoctoral Researcher </a>aat University of Richmond. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b>
								I am a Radio Astronomer and Experimental Cosmologist studying the behavior of the first stars and galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn. My work involves developing precise models and statistical techniques to extract extremely faint signals from noisy data.
								 <br>
						
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outside Work:</b>
							I love the outdoors! When I’m not analyzing radio astronomical data, you’ll likely find me hiking, backpacking, or doing something adventurous -like skydiving. Through my husband, I’ve also developed an interest in cars and racing (see <a href= https://86challenge.us> 86Challenge</a> and <a href = https://www.youtube.com/@404nobrakes> 404:Brakes Not Found</a>).
							I’m passionate about espresso and enjoy getting technical about it. My ideal shot comes from a freshly medium-roasted coffee (preferably from a local roastery), extracted at a 2.25 ratio in about 26–32 seconds.
							I have a soft spot for ’60s music and rarely miss my daily NPR Up First. I also enjoy Carnatic fusion and am currently training in Hindustani semi-classical vocals.

							<b> Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization</b> <br>

    One of my primary research interests is the phase of the Universe when the first stars and galaxies formed, roughly 300 million years after the Big Bang.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hydrogen spin–flip transition, which emits radiation at a rest wavelength of <strong>21 cm</strong> (rest frequency <strong>1420 MHz</strong>), is a powerful probe of these early epochs. 
	  Redshifted into the radio band (approximately <em>z</em> ≈ 6–30, or 50–200 MHz), this signal encodes information about the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic medium.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practice, detecting this cosmological signature is extremely challenging. Terrestrial radio-frequency interference, bright astrophysical foregrounds, ionospheric distortions, and instrumental systematics all complicate the measurement. 
	  The target signal is roughly <strong>6–8 orders of magnitude fainter</strong> than the foregrounds—aptly described as “trying to hear a hummingbird in the middle of a hurricane.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Towards this scientific endeavor, I am a member of the <a href="https://loco.lab.asu.edu/edges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EDGES Collaboration</a>. The <em>Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES)</em> is a single-antenna, low-frequency radio experiment designed to study Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization. 
	  EDGES is deployed at Inyarrimanha Ilgari Bundara, the CSIRO Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory. I primarily work with <strong>EDGES-3</strong>, which began operating in November 2022 following substantial hardware and software upgrades.
  </p>

							<b> Absolutely Calibrated Sky Map at 310 MHz </b><br> 

							<p>
    Sky maps are among the most fundamental datasets for understanding the night sky. In radio astronomy, such maps are essential for virtually all scientific studies. However, at very low radio frequencies (around meter wavelengths), we currently lack an absolutely calibrated map with a well-defined zero level.
  </p>

  <p>
    I collaborate with researchers at the University of Richmond and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Northern Virginia to address this gap. Using the <strong>Green Bank Telescope</strong>—the world’s largest fully steerable radio telescope—located in Green Bank, West Virginia, we are developing a new sky map at <strong>310 MHz</strong> with a custom-designed feed and receiver system.
  </p>
							</p>
								<b>Low Frequency Radio Recombination Lines</b><br> Radio Recombination lines are the type of spectral features due to electron transitions in a Rydberg atom (excited atom with atleast one electron in a high principal quantum number). These lines help understand the star formation and measurement of density and temperature of the surrounding gas. Low frequency radio recombination lines (<150 MHz) in Carbon and Hydrogen are of particular interest, as they have been considered a possible foregrounds in the redshifted 21cm measurements from Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization.
								I use data from EDGES to detect these unique spectral signatures and study their effects on both global and power spectrum measurements of the redshifted 21cm signal.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>Beam Calibration of LWA using Pulsar Gating</b><br>
								<br>For current generation ground-based radio interferometers aiming precision measurements, one of biggest shortcomings is understanding the instrumental systematics. In particular, a precise understanding of the antenna beam is demanded. I work with Very Large Array (VLA), Long Wavelength Array (LWA) in New Mexico and LWA in Owen's Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA) for making beam mapping measurements that will help improve our understanding of the instrument and find spectral features that affect EoR and Cosmic Dawn experiments.
								 To do this, I have done some preliminary study of a novel Pulsar Gating method of beam calibration, that helps map the average antenna beam of an interferometer in spatial and spectral axes.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Measurement of Neutron lifetime using Space based Neutron Spectrometer</b><br> Neutron, although being one of the fundamental particles that make up the matter, is still not very well understood. Experimental particle physicists have been trying to measure the lifetime of a free neutron particle for decades now, using two independent methods (counting the number of neutrons or counting the number of beta-decay products, as a function of time), that produce two different results which are over 5-standard deviations apart. 
								This discrepancy is not explained by systematic or statistical errors. More importantly, the mere 9-sec difference in these two measurements has significant impact in our understanding of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and primordial He abundance. A precise measurement will not only help place limits on physics beyond the standard model but also finally settle the long standing debate! 
								<br>As a Graduate Research Associate at Los Alamos National Lab, I have made a space-based measurement using data from the Lunar Prospector (LP) mission. The LP was in orbit around moon between Jan 1998 to July 1999, and provides the Moon as a unique test bed for this measurement with its two neutron spectrometers on-board. This technique makes use of interactions between Cosmic rays and the lunar sub-surface that emit gravitationally bound neutrons. I am using a monte-carlo based particle simulation code to model the neutron emission from the lunar surface. This combined with the orbital information of the spacecraft can be used to deduce the neutron lifetime. The study on effects of lunar surface compositions and temperatures on the measurement of neutron lifetime is the most detailed study of such systematic uncertainties to date.
