            <p>Ph.D. Astrophysics Student <br> School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University</p>

            <h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/mountain.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p><b>Education:</b> I grew up in a small town in Karnataka, India. I went to high school in Raichur, and then moved to Bangalore for my undergrad in Electronics & Communication Engineering at RV College of Engineering. I graduated in 2020 ranking 3rd in the University, with my thesis on 'Search for Galactic and high redshift absorption lines with LOFAR'. I then moved to Tempe Arizona, where I am currently pursuing Ph.D. in Astrophysics at the <a href="https://loco.lab.asu.edu"> Low-Frequency Cosmology lab</a>, School of Earth and Space Exploration.</p>
            <p><b>Research Interests:</b> My research falls in Radio Astronomy and Experimental Cosmology, specifically focusing on how the first stars and galaxies behaved during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn. Over the summers, I work at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico on measurement of Neutron lifetime using space-based Neutron Spectrometer.</p>
            <p><b>Outside Work:</b> I like outdoors! If I am not analyzing Radio Astronomical data, I am hiking, backpacking or doing something adventurous like sky-diving. Moving to Arizona has made my outdoor-self very excited with its proximity to numerous trails. I am also getting trained in Krav Maga (an Israeli martial arts) and Kick Boxing on weekday evenings. I enjoy 60s music and religiously listen to NPR and NYT podcasts every single day!</p>

            <p><b>Low Frequency Radio Recombination Lines</b><br> Radio Recombination lines are the type of spectral features due to electron transitions in a Rydberg atom. These lines help understand the star formation and measurement of density and temperature of the surrounding gas. I use data from EDGES to detect these unique spectral signatures.</p>
            <p><b>Beam Calibration of LWA using Pulsar Gating</b><br> One of my major research interests is studying the phase of the Universe during the formation of the first stars and galaxies. I work with Very Large Array (VLA) and Long Wavelength Array (LWA) for making beam mapping measurements to improve our understanding of the instrument.</p>
            <p><b>Measurement of Neutron lifetime using Space based Neutron Spectrometer</b><br> I am helping develop a third independent measurement using data from the Lunar Prospector mission. We make use of interactions between Cosmic rays and the lunar sub-surface that emit gravitationally bound neutrons.</p>
